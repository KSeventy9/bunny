<strong>Artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) is making a computer that thinks like a human (or eventually  better) - to be able to learn and to have new ideas. AI does not mean to make a  computer smart just by knowing more information. It is to build a machine that  can act as if it were smart and seem more human. This is called the&nbsp;Turing test</strong><strong>. </strong>    </p>
<p align="center"><br>
  <strong>Computers are very good at following  exact orders, and handling very specific things, but not good at dealing with  new things they haven't seen
   before.For example, a common computer program can  turn a report of names and hours worked into paychecks for the workers at a  company. But the same
   program could not answer questions from an employee about  why the company will not pay for nap time. That is the difference between a  program and AI.<br>
In some cases, AI can be&nbsp;simulated&nbsp;(imitated),  at least in certain areas. With enough effort, programmers can make a big  program that knows about 
many things and can answer questions about those  things. Programs that can beat humans at&nbsp;chess &nbsp; have been  around for a long time, but that's not 
true AI, it's just a very good program  on how to follow strategy to win at chess. If simulated AI is asked about  something it does not know, it cannot come 
up with a good answer based on other  things it already knows. For example, it might know the weather forecast, and  about how plants grow, but if asked if the
grass will be green next week,  simulated AI will not ever realize it needs to think about what the temperature  and rainfall will be for the next week. A true
AI program will be able to understand  how to answer new questions like that.<br>
To work in a world where answers are  not&nbsp;<em>yes</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>no</em>&nbsp;but also&nbsp;<em>maybe</em>,&nbsp;<em>likely</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>
not  likely</em>, researchers have worked on&nbsp;fuzzy logic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;neural networks</a>.<br>
Sometimes, AI is meant to be a  simulation of human intelligence, often as a part of research in the area  of&nbsp psychology</a>. In this case, it is the 
study of&nbsp;mental processes</a>&nbsp;through the  use of&nbsp; computer models</a>. The question of what it means to be&nbsp;<em>self-aware</em>&nbsp;or  
having&nbsp;<em>consciousness</em>&nbsp;(knowing that you have a physical body,  and how you think about your self) is part of it. If a computer sees itself i
 a mirror, would it realize what it sees? Can a computer be scared of&nbsp;<em>death</em>?</strong></p>
