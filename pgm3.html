<h1> Pros and Cons of Artificail Intelligence</h1> 
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul>Artificial intelligence finds applications in space exploration. Intelligent robots can be used to explore space. They are machines and hence have thea 
bility 
to endure the hostile environment of the interplanetary space. They can be made to adapt in such a way that planetary atmospheres do not affect their physical 
state and functioning.</ul>
<ul>Intelligent robots can be programmed to reach the Earth's nadirs. They can be used to dig for fuels. They can be used for mining purposes. The intelligence
of 
machines can be harnessed for exploring the depths of oceans. These machines serve human so well especially where human intelligence has serious limitations.
Intelligent machines can replace human beings in many areas of work.</ul> <ul>Robots can do certain laborious tasks. Painstaking activities, which have long 
been 
carried out by humans can be taken over by the robots. Owing to the intelligence programmed in them, the machines can shoulder responsibility to a certain 
extent. They can be made to manage themselves and their time to complete the assigned tasks.</ul> 
<ul>Emotions that often intercept rational thinking of a human being are not a hindrance for artificial thinkers. Lacking the emotional side, robots can think 
logically and take the right decisions. Sentiments are associated with moods that affect human efficiency. This is not the case with machines with artificial 
intelligence. </ul>
<ul>Thus artificial intelligence can be utilized in the completion of repetitive and time-consuming tasks efficiently. Intelligent machines can be employed to 
do 
certain dangerous tasks. Machines equipped with artificial intelligence can be made to thoughtfully plan towards the fulfillment of tasks and accordingly 
adjust their parameters such as their speed and time. They can be made to act quickly, unaffected by anything like emotion and take the tasks towards 
perfection.</ul>

<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>The first concern regarding the application of artificial intelligence is about ethics and moral values. Is it ethically correct to create replicas of 
human beings? Do our moral values allow us to recreate intelligence? Intelligence is after all a gift of nature. It may not be right to install it into a 
machine to make it work for our benefit.</ul>
<ul>The idea of machines replacing human beings sounds wonderful. It appears to save us from all the pain. But is it really such an exciting idea? Concepts 
such as wholeheartedness and dedication in work bear no existence in the world of artificial intelligence.</ul>
<ul>Imagine robots working in hospitals. Do you picture them showing care and concern towards the patients? Imagine intelligent machines employed in creative 
fields. Do you think the robots will excel in such fields? Thinking machines lack a creative mind. Human beings are emotional intellectuals. They think and 
feel. Their feelings guide their thoughts.</ul>
<ul>Eventually, it is up to you whether to stand by artificial intelligence or understand the likely disaster that it may lead to. In my view, there is no 
ideal replacement for human beings. Artificial intelligence can help alleviate the difficulties faced by man but intelligent machines can never be 'human'.
